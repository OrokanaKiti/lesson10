#This test is designed to take the results from a DuckDuckGo Search on "presidents of the united states" (instant answers) and return it then process it with known information to ensure accuracy
#this is lesson 10's HW project
# NOTE Finding a Instant search displaying all the presidents is taking up lots of time
# NOTE "The program for the Lesson 10 lab on Integration tests and the REST api has been changed.  It now involves verifying Presidents of the US being listed on the White House website." Check this! We might not need DDG
# NOTE for self later http://www.gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/ Might be useful to webscrape the data from a simple site
# NOTE Attempting to webscrape from this site wish me luck https://www.presidentsusa.net/presvplist.html also a git hub with a similar concept https://github.com/hitch17/sample-data/blob/master/presidents.json
# NOTE JSON FOUND THAT IS USABLE https://github.com/hitch17/sample-data/blob/master/presidents.json HAS A JSON FILE (INCORRECT DATA)
# LASTMINUTE time is getting short- too little time to continue to follow a pipe dream.. i NEED a json file to work with
# LASTMIUTE creating a Json File with all the data i needm, importing it as a var and then using IT to push my tests
#NOTE according to teacher it is still positive to find the  https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=Presidents+of+the+United+States&format=json&pretty=1 like i intiialy tried with no result.. trying teachers advice  ; w ; im so short on time
